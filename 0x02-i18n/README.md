# 0x02. i18n

This project explores the concepts and techniques of internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in web development. It covers various aspects, from basic translation and formatting to more advanced topics like handling pluralization, genders, and locale-specific data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand the importance of i18n and l10n in web development.
* Explain the difference between i18n and l10n.
* Use gettext to translate strings in Python.
* Create and use translation templates with Babel.
* Handle pluralization and genders in translations.
* Format dates, times, and numbers according to locale.
* Use a database to store translations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of tasks, each focusing on a specific concept or technique:

* **0-hello.py:** A basic Flask app that displays a translated "Hello world" message.
* **1-app.py:** A Flask app that displays a translated greeting message based on the user's preferred language.
* **2-app.py:** A Flask app that retrieves user information from a database and displays a personalized greeting message.
* **3-app.py:** A Flask app that handles pluralization in translations.
* **4-app.py:** A Flask app that formats dates and times according to locale.
* **5-app.py:** A Flask app that formats numbers according to locale.
* **6-app.py:** A Flask app that handles genders in translations.
* **7-app.py:** A Flask app that uses a database to store translations.

## Technologies Used
