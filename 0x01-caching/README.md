# 0x01-caching

This project explores different caching algorithms and their implementations. Caching is a crucial technique for improving the performance of applications by storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch it from the primary source.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand the benefits and use cases of caching.
* Explain different caching algorithms (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU).
* Implement these caching algorithms using Python.
* Analyze the performance of different caching strategies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of tasks, each focusing on a specific caching algorithm:

* **0-basic_cache.py:** Implements a basic caching system.
* **1-fifo_cache.py:** Implements the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) caching algorithm.
* **2-lifo_cache.py:** Implements the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) caching algorithm.
* **3-lru_cache.py:** Implements the LRU (Least Recently Used) caching algorithm.
* **4-mru_cache.py:** Implements the MRU (Most Recently Used) caching algorithm.
* **100-lfu_cache.py:** Implements the LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching algorithm.
